Nostra â€“ Modern E-commerce UI

Nostra is a responsive e-commerce website prototype built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive, user-friendly front-end interfaces with a focus on modern web design principles.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Dynamic Carousel: Smooth sliding banners with sticky text overlays.

Filterable Products: Users can filter items by occasion (Summer, Winter, Party).

Interactive UI Elements: Hover effects, sticky banners, and smooth scrolling navigation.

Clean & Maintainable Code: Structured for scalability and easy understanding.

This project showcases my front-end development skills, attention to detail, and ability to turn design concepts into fully functional web pages. Perfect for demonstrating readiness for UI/UX and front-end roles.
